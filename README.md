For Tensorflow users, please run `convca.py`.

For pyTorch users, please run `convca_pytorch.py`.

Note: The original code was written in Tensorflow. The pyTorch re-implementation was only tested on S1. I cannot promise that the performance will be the same as the Tensorflow version on all the subjects.
